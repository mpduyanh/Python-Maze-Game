A maze where the difficulty increases with each level. Do you think you are up to the challenges ahead?
But it isn't just a maze, if you unfortunately touch the maze wall, all your progress is lost and you will have to restart the entire game. 
First level requires the player to simply find the way out of the maze but the walls are very narrow. 
Second level requires the player to find the way to the key to escape through the door, but the path to the key isn't as easy as you think it is. 
The third level is easy...or is it? Though the walls are very wide, there are multiple exits and you have one chance to pick the correct one.
If you chose the wrong one, you will have to restart the game all over again.
After the third level, you have been granted your freedom, and the only thing you have to do is to make your way to the boat and escape! 
While the game is running, there will be intense music to help motivate you along the way. 
Goodluck! You're gonna need it.
